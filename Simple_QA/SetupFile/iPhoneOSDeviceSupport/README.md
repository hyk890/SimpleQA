Device Support files for Xcode, from iOS 6, up to iOS 12.0 (16A366).

How to:

1) Download version you need listed above;
2) Unzip it;
3) Close Xcode;
4) Copy and paste unziped folder by path: "/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/DeviceSupport/" (hierarchy like - https://github.com/filsv/iPhoneOSDeviceSupport/blob/master/Screen%20Shot%202018-09-16%20at%2019.52.35.png);
5) Reopen Xcode;

Because of some new updated terms of GitHub i can't upload folder, so I'll upload just a zip. 

Thank You.
